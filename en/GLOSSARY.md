# Bash console
One of the console types available on [PythonAnywhere](#PythonAnywhere).
It provides a command line interface to your PythonAnywhere account,
just like CMD on Windows or the terminal on OS X and Linux
provide a command line interface to your local computer.

See the [Deploy! chapter](./deploy/#configuring-our-site-on-pythonanywhere)
for how to access a bash console on PythonAnywhere.

# byte
A unit of data / digital information. See article "byte" [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byte).

# Boolean
(Short for "boolean value", named after [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole))
a value that can only be true or false.
In Python, the type `bool` is used for boolean values
and the names of the values are `True` and `False`
(with initial capital letters).

See sections [Compare things](./python_introduction/#compare-things) and [Boolean](./python_introduction/#boolean) in the "Introduction to Python" chapter.

# Bootstrap
The front-end framework we use to [make our page pretty](./css).

# class
In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects. It defines a set of properties & methods that are common to all objects of one type.

# code editor
Code editor is an application that allows you to save your code so you will be able to get back to it later. You can learn where to get one from the [Code editor chapter](./code_editor/README.md)

# command
A command is a line of text that is understood by your computer as an order that it has to execute.
For all of the things like starting programms, copying documents etc. that you can do using the mouse, there also exists a command.
Commands are usually typed in a special window (that is often black with white letters), that is called
the [command line](#command-line), [terminal](#command-line), [command prompt](#command-line) or [console](#command-line).

# Command Line
Command line is a black window with white text that all hackers use! It is a text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. For example, in the DjangoGirls tutorial, we use the terminal to interact with [Git](#git), a version control system.

# Command Prompt
The place in the [command line](#command-line) waiting for your command.
It looks something like `jane@janes-laptop:~$` on Linux or `C:\Users\jane>` on Windows.
Command prompt may also be used as a synonym of the [command line](#command-line).

# dependency
A dependency is some other code that is required for your code to run. For example, your web application is based on the framework Django, and that means Django is among its dependencies.

# deployment 
Deployment is the process of taking the code that powers your web application
and moving it to a publicly accessible computer (called a server) so that other people can see it.

# dictionary
A dictionary is a data structure in Python that contains keys and values, in pairs. You can find a value by the key but not vice versa. A dictionary is written with curly brackets. Here is an example of a dictionary:

# framework
A framework is an amount of prewritten code to help you write programms that do a certain task.
A lot of functionality needed to make a website for example is always the same.

The framework defines a lot of usefull functions that you can just use out of the box.

# function

# Git
A 'version control system' used by a lot of programmers. It allows you to track changes in your files so you can recall specific versions later. It works a bit like the "track changes" feature in Microsoft Word, but it is much more powerful.
Git uses [code repositories](#repository) to save changes to a particular set of files.

# virtualenv
short for [virtual environment](#virtual-environment)

# virtual environment
A virtual environment (also called a virtualenv) is	like a private box we can stuff	useful computer	code into for a	project
we're working on. We use them to keep the various bits of code we want for our various projects separate so things don't

# web application
A web application is an application, a programm, that runs in your browser
and typically requires an internet connection.
